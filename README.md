Neural Machine Translation By Jointly Learning To Align And Translate based on Dzmitry Bahdanau, KyungHyun Cho, Yoshua Bengio attention mechanism

● A fixed-length context vector is the bottleneck for translating long sentences.

● Alignment mechanism, i.e. soft-search for a set of input words or annotations, enhances translation on longer sentences.

● Alignment models trained and evaluated on English-to-French translation achieve higher accuracy than fixed-length encoder-decoder models, especially on longer sentences.
